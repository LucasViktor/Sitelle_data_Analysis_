Supernova remnants and their associated pulsars have long fascinated astronomers.
However, a persistent enigma remains; the absence of a supernova shell around certain
young pulsar wind nebulae. Perhaps, the most famous example is the Crab Nebula,
which after a decades-long search for its supernova shell with standard techniques in
radio and X-rays is still “shell-less”, a long-standing puzzle in Supernova Remnant
astrophysics. In this study, we address this question by employing the SITELLE in-
strument from the CFHT Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope (CFHT) equipped with a
large field of view and high-resolution spectroscopy of key emission lines. In particular,
we aim to survey a large region around the visible nebula using the coronal emission line
[FeXIV] λ5303 as a diagnostic for the search for the forward shock. Our methodology
consists of integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy with imagery to construct detailed
flux and velocity maps of the [FeXIV] line outside of the visible nebula. Leveraging the
emission modelling capabilities of the astrophysical code “MAPPINGS V”, we aim to
discern the intricate interplay of physical processes within and outside the nebula. Our
primary objective is to derive plasma temperature estimates and evaluate whether the
observed emission properties align with theoretical predictions for the forward shock.
By combining observational data with advanced modelling techniques, we aim to shed
light on the long-standing puzzle around the missing shell in this iconic pulsar wind
nebula.
